How many times have you needed to paste the same copied text multiple times?  
How many times have you needed to copy multiple pieces of texts and paste it without switching windows?

It stores your clipboard contents in a stack. Copying text pushes to the stack. Pasting pops it. As simple as that!  
Did you actually want to paste that thing at two places? No worries, copy it twice!
